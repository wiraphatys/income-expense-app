# income-expense-app
This project is a simple single webpage web application, with the main features of calculating the remaining balance and categorizing income and expenses. It displays the results separately to provide a clear overview of the financial situation. Additionally, there is a backend system and a database to store the financial history that has been entered into the budget.
## TECH-STACK
- I used pure JavaScript for the frontend because I wanted to practice and solidify my fundamental knowledge of JavaScript and gain a deeper understanding of web development. That's why I opted for pure JavaScript without using any frameworks or libraries.

- I chose Node.js and Express.js for the backend because this stack is beginner-friendly, easy to understand, and quick to learn, all while maintaining high performance.

- I chose MongoDB for my small-scale web application's database due to its flexibility and user-friendliness. MongoDB's adaptability to evolving data needs and its simplicity in usage make it a practical choice.
