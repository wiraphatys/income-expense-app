# income-expense-app
This project is a simple single webpage web application, with the main features of calculating the remaining balance and categorizing income and expenses. It displays the results separately to provide a clear overview of the financial situation. Additionally, there is a backend system and a database to store the financial history that has been entered into the budget.
